# Yet Another Shell

C++ version of [this](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) guide. Just a little experiment.

## TODO

Some ideas to implement:
- [] I/O Redirection `>`,`<`,`2>`
- [] Piping `|`
- [] Job Control & Background `&`
- [] Command History
- [] Tab Completion
- [] More builtins!
- [] Config file like `.bashrc`
- [] Shell Scripts
